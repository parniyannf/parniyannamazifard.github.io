# AM Radio Receiver Design

## Overview
Built and tested a functional AM radio receiver on a breadboard, implementing an LC tuner, diode-based envelope detector, and op-amp audio amplifier to successfully tune and demodulate broadcast signals in the 550–1600 kHz band.

## Key Features
- LC tuning circuit for station selection
- Diode-based envelope detector for demodulation
- Op-amp audio amplifier for headphone output
- Covers full AM broadcast band (550-1600 kHz)

## Testing & Validation
Validated circuit performance through hands-on testing with an oscilloscope and headphones, adjusting component values to optimize:
- Resonance frequency
- Bandwidth
- Detector ripple
- Audio clarity

## Results
Successfully tuned and received multiple AM broadcast stations with clear audio output.
